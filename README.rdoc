== MySQLPlus

An enhanced MySQL database driver. With support for async operations and threaded database access.

== Building

  gem build mysqlplus.gemspec

=== OS X  

  with the default mysql installed:

    sudo gem install mysqlplus-0.1.0.gem -- --with-mysql-config

  with mysql installed by macports:

    sudo gem install mysqlplus-0.1.0.gem -- --with-mysql-config=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysql_config

  with mysql installed by homebrew:

    sudo gem install mysqlplus -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.51/bin/mysql_config
  
  with x86 mysql (NOT x86_64!) installed from mysql.com:

    sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install mysqlplus-0.1.0.gem -- \
      --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql \
      --with-mysql-lib=/usr/local/mysql/lib \
      --with-mysql-include=/usr/local/mysql/include

=== Ubuntu

  apt-get install libmysql++-dev
  gem install mysqlplus

== Using
  to use within rails
  add require 'mysqlplus' to the top of environment.rb
  this instantiates the Mysql class that you can use.
  and it will automagically use async_query instead of query, so it's a drop in replacement.

  Same with other scripts that want to use it--just require 'mysqlplus' BEFORE you require 'mysql' and it will 
  load the asynchronous version, then ignore the sequent require 'mysql' call.

== Other helpful mysql utilities:
  slim attributes http://slim-attributes.rubyforge.org/ boosts mysql speed by using arrays instead of hashed lookup.
  Hash extension gem also results in speedups when used: http://blog.chak.org/2008/02/09/speeding-up-activerecord-with-hashes-take-2/
